        <p><em><strong>Founder</strong> and <strong>CEO</strong> of <strong>Full Stack Developement SRL</strong>,

        <p>With <strong>17 years</strong> of experience in <strong>IT, Business Development</strong> and

            in
            order to choose the best solution, and together achieve the best possible results while consuming as few

        <hr>
        <h2>2017-2020 <strong>Chief Executive Officer (C.E.O.) at Full Stack Development S.R.L. (Bucharest,
                Romania)</strong></h2>
        <img src="images/business.jpg" alt="Programming Company CEO" width="800" height="500">

        <p>In 2017 I’ve opened a technology company, create the business plan and applied to the <strong>“Start-up
                Nation”</strong>
            National financing program for small and medium size companies. Company’s mission was to create software
            programs and other devices by using the latest technologies like <strong>Blockchain</strong>,
            <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> and robotics.
            I’ve budgeted the salaries of a senior developer for one year, along with one junior developer and one
            designer. I have also included in the budget 2 Virtual Reality helmets, one server, two desktop computers, 2
            monitors, three laptops and a few mobile phones for native application testing.
            I start the business with a designer and setup a virtual reality environment using two <strong>HTC Vive
                Helmets</strong> and
            the open source software <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong> for creating the 3D space. Within this VR
            environment, the client
            is able to step into the virtual space, along with the designer, and decorate his home exactly the way he
            wants it and visualize the changes as they are made. The clients would then be able to see exactly how their
            home will look like and choose the best renovation solution and furniture, for their living needs. This
            solution started to produce immediate profit, while we worked on the development of other technological
            projects.
            However, the main source of income for the company was the development of different web-based platforms and
            mobile applications based on the blockchain technology. We raised the necessary funds needed for developing
            and implementing these solutions with the help of ICO’s (Initial Coin Offerings) by creating landing pages
            for each project and then develop the business further. The idea was a real success and it produced great
            results over the last year of activity, before I sold the company to a much bigger, multinational company.

            width="800" height="500">

        <p>I gained experience working with the most commonly known Forex trading platforms, <strong>Metatrader 4
            </strong>and <strong>Metatrader
                5</strong>. Moreover, I’ve also had the privilege to work with one of the most professional trading
            platforms in the
            Forex industry called <strong>Metastock</strong> and the <strong>Algorithmic Trading platform
                ZorroS.</strong>
            The fact that I had a solid background in Economics helped me to better understand the market impact of the
            major economic news and foresee the next market movements. Important trading tools like
            <strong>Metastock</strong> have also
            offer me a huge advantage over other Forex retail traders.
            I also traded in the cryptocurrency environment with <strong>Haas Online Trade server</strong>.
            <strong>HTS</strong> is a well-known trading
            software with incorporated automated trading strategies especially designed for the crypto-currency
            web-based exchanges. At the time, I purchased it the software had some bugs so it didn’t work exactly how it
            supposed to. These malfunctions caused some losses for me that’s why I didn’t used it for a very long period
            of time.
            Over this period of time, I’ve managed to raise my overall portfolio from 100k to around 234k.
            Even if it started only like a part-time passion activity, I thought it’s worth mentioning it on my C.V.
            since I had some notable results.

        <p><strong>Since 2012, I’ve worked in Doha, Qatar as IT Manager for a medium size real-estate organization. At
                that
                time, the company employed around 65 people. I was responsible for managing a team of 10. My
                responsibilities during this time were:</strong>
        </p>
    </center>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coordinate the content writers and web-developers for creating the company’s presentation website.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Creating a project plan of the database structure for the company’s online property management
                system and choose the
                appropriate technologies. For this purpose, we chose to work with <strong>HTML5, CSS and PHP
                    MySQL.</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li>With the help of <strong>Scrum and Agile P.M.</strong> techniques, we’ve also developed an
                Android-KNX mobile application for the
                company’s clients who lived in smart-home apartments or houses. With the help of this app, the
                clients were able to
                remotely control their homes functions, like: heating, cooling, lightning or any other electrical
                functions that could
                be atomized. The app was developed in Java and for the connection with the KNX devices; we’ve used a
                previously
                developed open-source API.</li>
            <br>
            <li>During the time I was in charge of the IT department, I’ve introduced to the company’s C.E.O. and
                Board of Directors a
                few smart-home automation technologies like: <strong>KNX, Fibaro and Inels.</strong> I presented
                these solutions as an advantage to the services that the company already has to offer. The higher
                management
                loved the idea and after a period of testing, they start implementing it.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Supervise and organize the development team for creating a mobile app (used on Android and IOS
                devices) for granting
                access to apartments or homes who use smart-locks systems that can be controlled remotely. After the
                payment for rent
                has been received through crypto-currency, debit/credit card or PayPal the app will send the access
                code to the user,
                granting him access to the location. For the successful implementation of these functions, we used a
                third party A.P.I.
                for crypto-currency payment integrations and the proprietary A.P.I. of PayPal for normal payments.
                The app was developed
                using Java and Swift programming languages with Agile P.M. techniques. The team has also used
                JetBrains programming
                tools for easing and standardizing the written code.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The last important project that I’ve worked on while I was employed at MD Holdings was a web
                application that stored
                the insurance data gathered from the insurance companies on a private Blockchain, making this data,
                secured, but also
                available to any company employee who has authorization to view it. The development team used: HTML,
                CSS, PHP, JetBrains
                Tools and VUE.js to develop this web app. I’ve organized and supervised the development of the app
                using the Agile P.M.
                techniques.</li>
